GenRiver3 is an open-source and free web application. The **source code** is available at [https://github.com/degi/genriver](https://github.com/degi/genriver), and the **online version** can be accessed at [https://genriver.agroforestri.id/](https://genriver.agroforestri.id/). The application was developed using R and JavaScript with the [R-Shiny](https://shiny.posit.co/) platform. It can be launched as a standalone application from the source code using [R](https://www.r-project.org/) or [RStudio](https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio/) (go to the [source code website](https://github.com/degi/genriver) and follow the instructions).

GenRiver3 is an update to the original [GenRiver version 2](https://www.worldagroforestry.org/output/genriver-generic-river-model-river-flow) developed by World Agroforestry (ICRAF). GenRiver v2 was implemented using [ISEE Stella](https://www.iseesystems.com/) and MS Excel macro script. GenRiver3 uses an algorithm similar to GenRiver v2 on its core module and adopts similar variable names in the source code.

#### Disclaimer and Copyright

Although efforts have been made to incorporate relevant process knowledge on a range of interactions, the model is not more (and not less) than a research tool. Model predictions may help develop specific hypotheses for research, explore potential management options, and extrapolate domains, but they should not be used as authoritative statements per se.

Copy right, but do not copy wrong. The GenRiver model was developed based on publicly funded research at the World Agroforestry Centre (ICRAF) and may be used for non-commercial research purposes in the interest of the smallholder agroforesters of the world.
