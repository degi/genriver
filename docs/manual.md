### Preface

Water flow in rivers is generated by rainfall and modified by landscape topography, vegetation, and soil, but also by human engineering to enhance drainage and/or retention of water. The degree to which river flow is influenced by land cover change (‘deforestation’, ‘reforestation’, ‘agroforestation’, and other code words) is hotly debated, as is the influence of ‘climate change’. A simple tool that relates the logic at the plot level to the river-level consequences was deemed relevant to assist in the analysis of catchment data. Existing models were either too complex and data-hungry or left out important processes, such as the impact of land use change in the soil and its physical condition.

GenRiver is a generic river flow model that responds to spatially explicit rainfall and keeps track of a plot-level water balance that responds to changes in vegetation and soil. The model treats a river as a summation of streams, each originating in a sub-catchment with its own daily rainfall, yearly land cover fractions, and routing time based on the distance to the river outflow (or measurement) point. Interactions between streams in their contribution to the river are considered to be negligible (i.e. there is no 'backflow' problem). Spatial patterns in daily rainfall events are translated into average daily rainfall in each sub-catchment in a separate module (Spatrain). The sub-catchment model represents interception, infiltration into the soil, rapid percolation into the subsoil, the surface flow of water, and rapid lateral subsurface flow into streams with parameters that can vary between land cover classes.

## How to run the software

GenRiver3 software is web application and the **online** version is available at: https://genriver.agroforestri.id/

The software can also be launched as a standalone app using R and RStudio. Following is the step-by-step to run the software from the source code as a standalone app.

### Installation Instructions
1. Install R from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/).
2. Install RStudio from [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).
3. Install the Shiny package in R:
    ```R
    install.packages("shiny")
    ```

### Launching the App
1. Open RStudio.
2. Load the Shiny library:
    ```R
    library(shiny)
    ```
3. Run the app directly from GitHub source code:
    ```R
    shiny::runGitHub("genriver", "degi")
    ```
    Another option is to download all the source codes from https://github.com/degi/genriver. Extract all files to a local folder and execute the script below 
    ```R
    runApp("path/to/your/app")
    ```
    > If you have the **source code** on the local folder, you will need an internet connection to run it for the first time. An internet connection is required for updating and initializing the R libraries. Once the updates are completed, you will be able to run the app **without an internet connection**.<br/>
    > *To be noted*: An internet connection might still be required for downloading the DEM. You can go without the internet once you have it in your saved parameters.
