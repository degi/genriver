### Preface

Water flow in rivers is generated by rainfall and modified by landscape topography, vegetation, and soil, but also by human engineering to enhance drainage and/or retention of water. The degree to which river flow is influenced by land cover change (‘deforestation’, ‘reforestation’, ‘agroforestation’, and other code words) is hotly debated, as is the influence of ‘climate change’. A simple tool that relates the logic at the plot level to the river-level consequences was deemed relevant to assist in the analysis of catchment data. Existing models were either too complex and data-hungry or left out important processes, such as the impact of land use change in the soil and its physical condition.

GenRiver is a generic river flow model that responds to spatially explicit rainfall and keeps track of a plot-level water balance that responds to changes in vegetation and soil. The model treats a river as a summation of streams, each originating in a sub-catchment with its own daily rainfall, yearly land cover fractions, and routing time based on the distance to the river outflow (or measurement) point. Interactions between streams in their contribution to the river are considered to be negligible (i.e. there is no 'backflow' problem). Spatial patterns in daily rainfall events are translated into average daily rainfall in each sub-catchment in a separate module (Spatrain). The sub-catchment model represents interception, infiltration into the soil, rapid percolation into the subsoil, the surface flow of water, and rapid lateral subsurface flow into streams with parameters that can vary between land cover classes.

## How to run the software

GenRiver3 software is web application and the **online** version is available at: https://genriver.agroforestri.id/

The software can also be launched as a standalone app using R and RStudio. Following is the step-by-step to run the software from the source code as a standalone app.

### Installation Instructions
1. Install R from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/).
2. Install RStudio from [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).
3. Install the Shiny package in R:
    ```R
    install.packages("shiny")
    ```

### Launching the App
1. Open RStudio.
2. Load the Shiny library:
    ```R
    library(shiny)
    ```
3. Run the app directly from GitHub source code:
    ```R
    shiny::runGitHub("genriver", "degi")
    ```
    Another option is to download all the source codes from https://github.com/degi/genriver. Extract all files to a local folder and execute the script below 
    ```R
    runApp("path/to/your/app")
    ```
    > If you have the **source code** on the local folder, you will need an internet connection to run it for the first time. An internet connection is required for updating and initializing the R libraries. Once the updates are completed, you will be able to run the app **without an internet connection**.<br/>
    > *To be noted*: An internet connection might still be required for downloading the DEM. You can go without the internet once you have it in your saved parameters.

## Glossary ##

- **Base flow** is the portion of stream flow that derives from groundwater and is not related to current or recent rainfall.
- **BD/BDref** is the bulk density of a soil layer relative to the ‘reference bulk density’ that can be expected for soil of similar texture under natural forest conditions
- **Buffering capacity** is the ability of a system to reduce the impact of external variation on internal properties, e.g. reducing the variation in stream flow relative to variation in rainfall.
- **Buffering indicator** is derived from the ratio of above-average stream flow and above-average rainfall.
- **Buffering for peak events** is the ‘buffer’ function demonstrated at peak rainfall events.
- **C/Cref** is the organic soil carbon content of a soil relative to the ‘reference soil Corg concentration’ that can be expected for soil of similar texture, pH, and mineralogy under natural forest conditions at the given elevation (temperature regime)
The discharge or Outflow of a river is the volume of water it transports in a certain amount of time. The unit used is usually m³/s (cubic meters per second).
- **Evapotranspiration** is a term used to describe the sum of evaporation and plant transpiration from the earth's land surface to the atmosphere. Evaporation accounts for the movement of water to the air from sources such as the soil, canopy interception, and waterbodies. Transpiration accounts for the movement of water within a plant and the subsequent loss of water as vapor through stomata in its leaves.
- **Field capacity** is the volumetric soil water content measured 1 day after a saturating rainfall event, when rapid drainage and interflow have removed excess water to streams or groundwater
- **Flash floods** are floods caused by heavy or excessive rainfall in a short period, generally under 6 hours. They cause stream flow and water levels to rise and fall rapidly.
- **Flow persistenc**e is the minimum volume of river flow that can be expected as a fraction of flow on the previous day
- **Gradual water release** is a gradual release of (ground) water during periods without rainfall (‘dry season)
- **Groundwater discharge** is the release of groundwater to streams or subsurface flows.
- **Interflow** see Quickflow
- **Low flow** is flow through a watercourse after a prolonged absence of rainfall.
- **Overland flow** see surface runoff 
- **Overflow or Bank overflow** is a flow of water outside of the regular river bed during conditions where recent inflow minus outflow has exceeded the storage capacity.
- **Peak flows** is the maximum flow through a watercourse.
- **Precipitation** is all forms of water particles, whether liquid or solid, that fall from the atmosphere to the ground. Distinguished from cloud, fog, dew, and frost, precipitation includes rain, drizzle, snow, and hail.
- **Quickflow or Interflow** is part of a storm rainfall that moves laterally through hillslope soils to a stream channel; it infiltrates the soil, but cannot be retained by the soil at its ‘field capacity’; shallow groundwater or interflow may emerge at the surface at the bottom of slopes and flow across the ground surface to the stream.
- **Relative buffering indicator** is the ‘buffer’ function adjusted for relative annual water yield
- **River flow** is the flow of water in the river channel
- **Storage capacity** is the total amount of water that can be stored in a reservoir before overflow occurs.
- **Stream flow** is the flow of water in streams, rivers, and other channels.
- **Surface runoff or Overland flow** is the flow across the land surface of the water  when the rainfall rate exceeds the infiltration capacity of the soil. The rate of infiltration, and therefore the possibility of surface runoff, is determined by such factors as soil type, vegetation, and the presence of shallow, relatively impermeable, soil horizons. Saturated overland flow can occur when a temporary rise of the water table inhibits infiltration and causes flow over the surface.
- **Total discharge fraction** is the total water yield (discharge) per unit of rainfall, usually on an annual basis.
- **Water balance** is the comparison over a certain period (e.g. month or year) of inflow of water (precipitation) and outflows by evapotranspiration, stream flow, and subsurface flows.
- **Water quality** is the chemical, physical, and biological characteristics of water concerning its suitability for a particular use.
- **Water storage** is the volume of water that can be (temporarily) withheld from evapotranspiration, stream flow, or subsurface flows, either above ground in lakes, rivers, and other waterways or below ground as groundwater.
- **Water transmission** is the fraction of incoming precipitation that is converted into stream flow.
