### Preface

Water flow in rivers is generated by rainfall and modified by landscape topogra-phy, vegetation and soil, but also by human engineering to enhance drainage and/or retention of water. The degree to which river flow is influenced by land cover change (‘deforestation’, ‘reforestation’, ‘agroforestation’ and other code words) is hotly debated, as is the influence of ‘climate change’. A simple tool that relates the logic at plot level to the river-level consequences was deemed relevant to assist in the analysis of catchment data. Existing models were either too complex and data-hungry or left out important processes, such as the impact of land use change in the soil and its physical condition.

GenRiver a generic river flow model that responds to spatially explicit rainfall and keeps track of a plot-level water balance that responds to changes in vegetation and soil. The model treats a river as a summation of streams, each originating in a subcatchment with its own daily rainfall, yearly land cover fractions and routing time based on distance to the river outflow (or measurement) point. Interactions between streams in their contribution to the river are considered to be negligible (i.e. there is no 'backflow' problem). Spatial patterns in daily rainfall events are translated into average daily rainfall in each subcatchment in a separate module (Spatrain). The subcatchment model represents interception, infiltration into soil, rapid percolation into subsoil, surface flow of water and rapid lateral subsurface flow into streams with parameters that can vary between land cover classes.

## How to run the software

The software is a web application and can be launched online at https://genriver.agroforestri.id/

It can also launched as standalone application using R and RStudio. 

### Installation Instructions
1. Install R from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/).
2. Install RStudio from [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).
3. Install the Shiny package in R:
    ```R
    install.packages("shiny")
    ```

### Launching the Shiny App
1. Open RStudio.
2. Load the Shiny library:
    ```R
    library(shiny)
    ```
3. Run the app directly from GitHub source code:
    ```R
    shiny::runGitHub("genriver", "degi")
    ```
    Another option is to download first the source code from https://github.com/degi/genriver. Extract the files to local folder and execute this script 
    ```R
    runApp("path/to/your/app")
    ```
    If you have the source code on local folder, you can run the app **without internet connection**. Except the first time for initialization of the R libraries.
